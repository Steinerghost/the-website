                    <p class="description">Assisting with laboratory duties in line with Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) and
                    International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) regulations. Days started by accepting seed samples from various farming companies both locally
                    and internationally, giving the team an idea of the workload/type for the shift. Individuals would be either mixing or screening the seed samples
                    under the above regulations in order to prepare them for the seed analysts to examine. Each person on the team would process at least 40 samples
                    per day. The equipment used would have to be cleaned in between each sample to prevent contaimination. This was the hardest part of the job, as one
                    seed left behind could contaminate an entire sample. These seeds could be as small as a pinhead, and can float through the air. These aspects of the
                    job fostered strong attention to detail due to the cleaning processes, as well as priority management by ensuring the vast variety of sample types
                    were processed efficiently given the possible equipment/talent bottlenecks.</p>

                    <h2 class="description-title">Description</h2>
                    <p class="description">For my environmental engineering internship, I worked with Dr. Tyler Radniecki in his environmental engineering lab.
                    I worked with him during the school year, and then was able to persue the opporunity fulltime due to the Johnson Internship.
                    My project was titled "The Effects of Heavy Metals on Anaerobic Co-Digesters". This project was based on optimizing methane production at
                    wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Microbes within WWTP can consume organic material, and create methane. This methane can then be used
                    for energy. The ultimate goal is to make WWTPs self sufficient using this methodology. My project looked at how heavy metal contaminants
                    commonly found in wastewater would affect methane production. My day to day tasks revolved around managing my own batch reactors which modeled
                    WWTP reservois, and maintaining the lab through cleaning and material preparation. I would assemble/disassemble batch reactors using sludge samples
                    obtained from the Corvallis WWTP, and vary levels of common heavy metals and organic materials. Routines involved measuring levels of gas output
                    and reactor characteristics such as organic solid levels and pH. Lab maintenence revolved around ensuring courteous lab usage, such as replacing used
                    buffers, cleaning glassware, and disposing of hazardous materials. I would attend weekly lab meeting to discuss progress and possible next steps.
                    My internship ended with a presentation poster being presented at an engineering symposium to incoming underclassmen.</p>

                    <p class="description">The volunteer work acted as an outreach program for children K-12. The goal was to get kids excited about
                    pursuing a career in a STEM field. To accomplish this, a group of volunteers would visit schools throughout the area and perform science
                    demonstrations in front of the children and parents. These demonstrations were held in a open house fashion, where groups could come
                    and go as they please to visit other booths. Typically, the experiments we would run would be reverse engineering diapers, creating gels beads
                    in solution, and operating a balance controlled segway. These experiments helped me practice public speaking to a diverse audience. Technical
                    information varied in complexity depending if I was talking to an adult, highschooler, or 3rd grader. Working with these kids also give me
                    a great sense of pride hoping that I helped shape someones life in the sciences. Watching children have fun with making gel worms and brag
                    to their parents and peers showed they were engaged, and that we accomplished our mission.</p>

                    <p class="description">Clackamas Community College has a stellar math department, with part of that being due to the math lab. The math lab
                    was an open house style learning environment where students could come and get their math questions answered. They operated from the early morning
                    to late at night to give students of all availabilities the opportunity to get help. As a math tutor, it was our job to help students either 1 on 1
                    or in groups to help with their math questions. We had extensive training in technical communication in order to better serve our community. We needed
                    to be able to communicate information accurately to a vast variety of ability levels inluding those with disabilities. We also provided personal tutoring
                    for those that needed extra help. My favorite part of the job was discussing Someone's triumph over that test that the student and I spent hours preparing
                    for. I built great relationships with my supervisors, co-workers, and clients, some of whom I still see today.</p>
