                <p class="description">Assisting with laboratory duties in line with Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) and
                International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) regulations. Days started by accepting seed samples from various farming companies both locally
                and internationally, giving the team an idea of the workload/type for the shift. Individuals would be either mixing or screening the seed samples
                under the above regulations in order to prepare them for the seed analysts to examine. Each person on the team would process at least 40 samples
                per day. The equipment used would have to be cleaned in between each sample to prevent contaimination. This was the hardest part of the job, as one
                seed left behind could contaminate an entire sample. These seeds could be as small as a pinhead, and can float through the air. These aspects of the
                job fostered strong attention to detail due to the cleaning processes, as well as priority management by ensuring the vast variety of sample types
                were processed efficiently given the possible equipment/talent bottlenecks.</p>
